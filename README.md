# The Big Torch Tutorial

The goal of this guide is to create an end to end guide for using torch. If you find this project useful give me a shout on twitter [@Algomancer](https://twitter.com/Algomancer). I am always keen to chat to cool people working on awesome stuff.

## Torch 

The Torch is a scientific computing framework with wide support for machine learning algorithms that puts GPUs first. It is an extension to LuaJIT which adds support for n dimensional arrays and numerical computing. Torch is wonderful, and is already used within Facebook, Google, Twitter, NYU, IDIAP, Purdue and many other companies and research labs. Torch includes a whole bunch of packages for neural networks, optimization, graphical models and image processing.
