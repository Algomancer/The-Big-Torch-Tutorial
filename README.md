# The Big Torch Tutorial
Torch is a scientific computing framework with wide support for machine learning algorithms that puts GPUs first.
Torch is used by Google DeepMind, the Facebook AI Research Group, IBM and Yandex and is an extension of the LuaJIT
language which adds support for n dimensional arrays and numerical computing. It includes an object-oriented package
for creating packages for neural networks, optimization,graphical models and image processing

The goal of this guide is to create an end to end guide for using torch. If you find this guide useful give me a shout on twitter [@Algomancer](https://twitter.com/Algomancer). I am always keen to chat to cool people working on awesome stuff.

Torch is wonderful, and is already used within Facebook, Google, Twitter, NYU, IDIAP, Purdue and many other companies and research labs. Torch includes a whole bunch of packages for neural networks, optimization, graphical models and image processing.
