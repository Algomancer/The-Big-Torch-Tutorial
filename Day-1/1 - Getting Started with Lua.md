# Getting Started with Lua
This guide assumes general programming knowledge, for a rapid introduction to LUA. Tyler Neylon has created a

### Why LuaJIT?

 The language itself is simple, readable and has clear constructs. It has a clean interface to C and is embeddable
 into any environment. LuaJIT is an extremely fast scripting language, with a transparent JIT Compiler.

 You can easily port your code, for example, the Torch framework runs on an iPhone & Android with no modification to code.
